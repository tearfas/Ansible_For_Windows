* install
* configure
* unlink

Requirements
------------

Download the Nessus Agent installer from https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus-agents and copy it to a local archive server. Tenable does not permit using their servers as a download mirror for automated installations.

For RedHat, the archive server where you host the RPM installer could be a yum repository on a locally hosted [Nexus Repository Manager](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss) or a RedHat Satellite channel. When this role executes, it assumes the repository is already configured and the package would be available via standard `yum install` commands.

For Windows, Nexus also offers Chocolatey/Nuget hosting option for archiving the MSI installer after packaging it for nuget installs.

Role Defaults
-------------

The `nessus_agent_group` variable defaults to either LINUX or WINDOWS, depending on the server it is connected to and can be overridden at runtime.

```
# The key should be overridden at runtime to a base16 string with ~64 characters.
nessus_agent_key: ""
nessus_agent_host: cloud.tenable.com
nessus_agent_port: 443

nessus_unlink: false
```
